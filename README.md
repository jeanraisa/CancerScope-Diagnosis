# Cancer Diagnosis using Neural Networks

# Project Overview
This project aims to indicate  cancer diagnosis status using a  simple machine learning model based on neural networks and optmized model.

# About Dataset
Data has been collected from different hospitals and contains medical and lifestyle information for patients, and is balanced with respect to feature distributions and includes realistic variability in patient data.
* Age: patient's age, ranging from 20 to 80.
* GeneticRisk: representing genetic risk levels for cancer, with 0 indicating Low, 1 indicating Medium, and 2 indicating High.
* Smoking: indicating smoking status.
* AlcoholIntake: representing the number of alcohol units consumed per week.
* Diagnosis:  indicating the cancer diagnosis status, where 0 indicates No Cancer and 1 indicates Cancer.
* PhysicalActivity: representing the number of hours per week spent on physical activities, ranging from 0 to 10.

# Instructions for running
* Clone this repository.
* Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries (TensorFlow, NumPy, etc.).
* Run the CancerScope_Model.ipynb to train and evaluate the models.
* To load the saved models, use model1.pkl for the simple neural network and model2.pkl for the optimized neural network.

# Model accuracy
* Simple model achieved 
* Optmized mode achieved
